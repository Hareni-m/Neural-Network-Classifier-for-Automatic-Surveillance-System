# Neural-Network-Classifier-for-Automatic-Surveillance-System
# Objective:
•	To Develop a system that accurately detects faces in surveillance videos using Haar Cascade methodology.
•	Creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to classify detected faces into predefined data’s for surveillance purposes.
•	To Assess the system's performance - accuracy, speed and reliability.
•	To test against common factors like varying lighting conditions and facial expressions.
•	To optimize the system parameters and algorithms to enhance its overall performance.
